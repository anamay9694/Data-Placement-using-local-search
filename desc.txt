The description of the problem is as follows:

1.  We have a set of caches F, a set of clients D, and a set of data
objects O. Each cache i can store at most u_i data objects. Each
client j∈ D has demand d_j for a specific data object o(j) ∈ O and
has to be assigned to a cache that stores that object.

2.  Storing an object o in cache i incurs a storage cost of f_io , and
assigning client j to cache i incurs an access cost of d_j c_ij .

3.  The goal is to find a placement of the data objects to caches
respecting the capacity constraints, and an assignment of clients
to caches, so as to minimize the total storage and client access
costs.
