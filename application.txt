    A content delivery network or content distribution network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers deployed 
in multiple data centers. The goal of a CDN is to serve content to end- users with high availability and high performance. 
CDNs serve a large fraction of the Internet content today, including web objects (text, graphics and scripts) and social networks
amongst others. 

Having an efficient algorithm for data placement problem will help in this process.
