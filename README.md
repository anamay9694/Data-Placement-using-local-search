# Data-Placement-using-local-search
Data Placement problem solved using local search moves of add,delete and swap
 
The project was done as a part of Summer Research Internship in The University of Lethbridge, under Professor Daya Gaur (Computer
Science and Mathematics) for which I was selected by Mitacs (2016 Summmer).

1. We have devised local search based algorithm for the data placement problem.

2.  The local search moves of add, delete and swap ,used in the
local search solution of the 3 approximation algorithm of
Uncapacitated Facility Location problem, in the book “The
Design Of Approximation Algorithms” by David P. Williamson,
David B. Shmoys, are used in the current version of Local
search.

3. The code for Uncapacitated facility location problem has been
verified by the OR library test cases.

4. The main code is the cpp file: main_code.cpp
5 .The supporting header file to perform the local search moves of add, delete and swap for uncapacitated facility location problem is:
ufl_n_cache_local_first_come.h
6. The descption of the problem is presented in: desc.txt
7. The application of the problem is presented in: application.txt
8. A test input file is presented in :input.txt
9. A description of the output is presented in :desc_output.txt
